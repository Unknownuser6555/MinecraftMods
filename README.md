In order to proceed, and join the server. You will need to download these mods to play on the server.

It's straight forward really, to start follow these steps:

1. Download the mods
2. Download Java 17
3. Download Forge 1.20.1 (install it client)
4. Download the curseforge app
5. Open the curseforge app, and make a new modpack
6. Click on your new modpack, and click the 3 dots (open in folder)
7. Paste the mods there and run your modpack through the curseforge app

I will say this as a disclaimer; the server IP may change overtime (I will probably host it for as long as I can before I get rate limited again!) however, the server IP will be displayed the second this message is written out. 

WARNING: All credit goes to the original owners of the respective mods, I do not claim them as my own, only resharing and providing steps for them to join the minecraft server. I myself, and all the respective owners are not liable if something goes wrong.
